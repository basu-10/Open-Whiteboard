## Shortcuts:
m = marker
s = select
t = text insert
backspace = Delete
Ctrl+ z = undo
Ctrl+ y = redo

## to do 

- copy paste function for all elements
- direct pasting - ctrl + v in the website pastes whatever is in clipboard
- custom canvas color
- table pasting preserves format of table 
- image crop handles alonside resize handles by default
- after selection done with select tool, options pop up to - delete, duplicate
- panning (Ctrl + drag): for mobile -  pan button 



## issues

- canvas saveState() does not include saving:
	- custom color palette

	- tool selection

	- canvas dimensions
